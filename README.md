# puzzleApp
This is a puzzle solver app
This puzzle app is based on Donald Knuth's DLX algorithm(dancing link alogrithm) (see: http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047 and https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jchu/publicportal/sudoku/0011047.pdf). 
In addition, four of my modules, parser, search, link, and matrix, are derived from Alex Rudnick's Automatic Sudoku Solving with Dancing Links project. (see https://code.google.com/archive/p/narorumo/)
All external sources that used have been referecened and after lots of modifications. Also, thank all TA's to teach me a general idea on how to implement the project. in Monday's TA session
